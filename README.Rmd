The goal of scrappy is to provide simple functions to scrape data from different
websites for academic purposes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of scrappy from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("scrappy")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/villegar/scrappy) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("villegar/scrappy")
```
## Example

__NOTE:__ To run the following examples on your computer, you need to download
and install Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/). Alternatively,
you can replace the value of `browser` in the call to `RSelenium::rsDriver`.

```{r run-examples-hidden-code, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, output = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# Create RSelenium session
rD <- RSelenium::rsDriver(browser = "firefox", port = 4549L, verbose = FALSE)

# Call scrappy
out_newa <- scrappy::newa_nrcc(
  client = rD$client,
  year = 2020,
  month = 12, # December
  station = "gbe", # Geneva (Bejo) station
  save_file = FALSE
) # Don't save output

out_gmaps <- scrappy::google_maps(
  client = rD$client,
  name = "Sefton Park",
  max_reviews = 20
)

out_gpp <- scrappy::find_a_gp(rD$client, postcode = "L69 3GL")

# Stop server
conn <- rD$server$stop()
```

### NEWA @ Cornell University
The Network for Environment and Weather Applications at Cornell University.
Website: http://newa.cornell.edu

```{r example-newa, eval = FALSE}
# Create RSelenium session
rD <- RSelenium::rsDriver(browser = "firefox", port = 4549L, verbose = FALSE)

# Call scrappy
out <- scrappy::newa_nrcc(
  client = rD$client,
  year = 2020,
  month = 12, # December
  station = "gbe", # Geneva (Bejo) station
  save_file = FALSE
) # Don't save output to a CSV file
# Stop server
rD$server$stop()
```

Partial output from the previous example:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(out_newa, 10))
```

### Google Maps

Extract the reviews for Sefton Park in Liverpool (only the 20 most recent):
```{r example-google-maps, eval = FALSE}
# Create RSelenium session
rD <- RSelenium::rsDriver(browser = "firefox", port = 4549L, verbose = FALSE)

# Call scrappy
out <- scrappy::google_maps(
  client = rD$client,
  name = "Sefton Park",
  max_reviews = 20
)
# Stop server
rD$server$stop()
```

Output after removing original authors' names and URL to their profiles:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
`%>%` <- scrappy::`%>%`
out_gmaps %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    author = paste0("Author ", seq_along(author)),
    author_url = ""
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### NHS GP practices by postcode

```{r example-nhs-gpp, eval = FALSE}
# Create RSelenium session
rD <- RSelenium::rsDriver(browser = "firefox", port = 4549L, verbose = FALSE)

# Retrieve GP practices near L69 3GL
# (Waterhouse building, University of Liverpool)
out <- scrappy::find_a_gp(rD$client, postcode = "L69 3GL")

# Stop server
rD$server$stop()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(out_gpp)
```
