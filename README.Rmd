The goal of scrappy is to provide simple functions to scrape data from different
websites for academic purposes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of scrappy from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("scrappy")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/villegar/scrappy) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("villegar/scrappy")
```
## Example

### NEWA @ Cornell University
The Network for Environment and Weather Applications at Cornell University.
Website: http://newa.cornell.edu

```{r example, message = FALSE}
# Create RSelenium session
rD <- RSelenium::rsDriver(browser = "firefox", port = 4548L, verbose = FALSE)

# Call scrappy
out <- scrappy::newa_nrcc(client = rD$client, 
                          year = 2020, 
                          month = 12, # December
                          station = "gbe", # Geneva (Bejo) station
                          save_file = FALSE) # Don't save output to a CSV file
# Stop server
rD$server$stop()
```

Partial output from the previous example:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(out, 10))
```
